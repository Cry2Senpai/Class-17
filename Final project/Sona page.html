                <p>Sona is a ranged ability power support with a large amount of utility. She has slows, a speed boost and a nasty ultimate. Her abilities revolve around boosting herself and her allies during the game. She is an extremally soft champ but makes up for it with heals and damage increase abilities. Below is my basic build for support Sona. </p>

                <h3>Eye of the watchers
                </h3>
                <p>Eye of the watchers is a good starting item because it offers early game mana regeneration, small amount of ability power, slight cooldown reduction and a passive the gives you 3 wards for vision in bot lane. Since it gives you 3 wards you can cover bot lane so that you and your lane mate can spot an incoming gank. You also gain 15 gold 3 times every thirty seconds when you hit an enemy champ with a spell to assist with the lack of gold you get in lane. </p>

                <h3>Sorcerers shoes</a>
                </h3>
                <p> Next up we have Sorcerers shoes, this is a very basic item the provides Sona with some movement speed as well as slight magic penetration. Naturally Sona has an extremally low movement speed this item helps to move her along. </p>

                <h3>Lich bane
                </h3>
                <p> Lich bane is one of my favorite items and to me is a must have on a Sona. Lich bane does a lot for sona in the damage department because of her skills and her passive. It provides a good amount of ability power as well as some cooldown reduction but the magic is in the passive. Lich banes passive spellblade increases the damage of your next basic attack and deals it out as magic damage based off of your attack damage and ability power after you have cast a spell. This works incredibly well with Sona's passive Power chord which after 3 spell casts her next basic attack increases in damage and has an additional effect based on the last ability used. This matched with her Q Hymn of valor causes a massive burst of damage in a short time. </p>

                <h3>Ardent censer
                </h3>
                <p>Next up we have Ardent censer which is a utility based item because of its passives. Ardent censer provides decent amount of ability power, cooldown reduction and mana regeneration and is great for Sona because of her W Aria of perseverance. Her W heals herself and her allies as well as giving a small shield equal to a portion of her ability power. With the first of ardent censers passives Sona's heal provides her allies with an attack speed buff, a on hit damage buff and a smaller heal with on hit attacks for 6 seconds. Those alone allow further sustain for Sona and her allies but with the second passive her heal and shield increase by an extra 10%. </p>

                <h3>Ludens echo 
                </h3>
                <p> Ludens echo gives some ability power and extra poke along with some movement speed, this allows you to reposition better. With is passive though you deal extra damage after you reach 100 stacks from moving or casting spells. This damage bounces off the main target and hits up to 4 other targets which also applies on hit effects. </p>

                <h3>Athenes unholy grail
                </h3>
                <p> Athenes unholy grail is an amzing itm for a utility and heal based support. Since Sona spams her skills a lot the little buts of damage she deals gets collected in blood charges. The charges assist with your heals and shields. If you collect the maximum amount of blood charges your heal or shield will be doubled. Along with this the item provides you with a nice increase to you mana and health regeneration. </p>
