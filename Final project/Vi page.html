                </h1>
                <p>Vi is one of my top champs because she’s a bruiser class character. There are multiple ways to builder allowing you to accommodate for a variety of enemies. Her skill set allows you to either get into your enemies face or pill drive right past them towards the squishes. If she gets some early game kills and a nice amount of gold she can snowball like all hell. Below ill have a pretty basic build for an ad/tank Vi.</p>

                <h3>Stalker blade warrior
                </h3>
                <p>This is a standard item for attack damage junglers, gives good attack damage for a starting item and a little bit of cool down reduction. With the chilling smite effect that slows your enemy your able to run in or out with relative ease. </p>

                <h3>Dead mans plate</a>
                </h3>
                <p> With dead mans plate you gain a decent amount of armor and hp. It also has a unique passive that increases your movement speed after you've collected enough movement stacks. While your moving if you auto anything your current number of stacks are depleted and you deal extra damage equal to half your stacks. If your stacks are at 100 your damage is doubled equaling 200 and you slow the target by 50%. This is great for an engage item because it applies an initial slow that helps keep your enemy close to you. </p>

                <h3>Trinity force
                </h3>
                <p>Trinity force is an amazing item because it gives multiple benefits but the main thing to pay attention to is the spellblade passive. With it whenever you activate a skill your next basic attack does 200% of your attack damage this matched with Vi's E excessive force you do heavy damage in a short burst. That isn’t the only good part though you gain hp, mana, movement speed, cool down reduction, and attack speed. Trinity force is an all-around win-win because of the multiple benefits. Thanks to its other passive rage, you gain movement speed when you hit an enemy champion or monster. </p>

                <h3>The Black cleaver
                </h3>
                <p>Now the black cleaver provides a good amount of cool down reduction and some nice tankness in terms of hp but the biggest deal is in the unique passive. When you hit an enemy champ with a skill or an auto you remove 5% of their armor this stacks 6 times for a total of 30% armor reduction. This with Vi's passive W Denting blows that reduces armor by 20% you are able to peel down tanks because you cut their armor in half.</p>

                <h3>Warmongs armor
                </h3>
                <p>I choice warmongs armor because it gives a great amount of hp which works well with Vi's passive Blast Shield that give Vi a shield equal to 10% of her maximum hp. This combined with warmongs regeneration passive the more hp you have the quicker you gain it back after leaving from combat. </p>
            </div>

                <h3>Banshees veil
                </h3>
                <p> Banshees veil is the last item in the build because it rounds out Vi in her defensive stance because it gives her some magic resist that the rest of the build is missing. Along with magic resistance you gain some hp and a great hp regeneration but the passive is great because it protects you from 1 spell cast from an enemy. This protects you from any initial attack because it blocks the effect as well as the damage. </p>
